/* Learn to use a Debugging tool


A debugging tool or debugger is a software (that’s already available in IDE) which allows programmers to stop a program at any point and helps to detect and correct errors.
When you have bugs in your program, rather than scratching your head to find the bug, you can use debugger to stop program at any point and find the value of variables to detect the bug. 
Knowing how to use a debugger is an important skill that every programmer should learn. 
Learn the feature the way it is intended


 
Imagine a situation: It’s possible to solve a problem with an array. Also, you can solve the same problem with a structure. Technically both are correct, which method will you use?
To answer this question, you should have a good knowledge of when to use an array and when to use a structure.
Suppose, you are switching to C from a different language, let’s say C#. You do not want to write C# style code with C syntax in your C program.
Join C communities


Once you get the hang of writing simple C programs, join online communities and forums. You can help other programmers where you can and ask for help when you are stuck. 

Communities Programiz recommends you to join:

Private Google forum for C Programmers - It’s a gem for C programming beginners.
Codechef - Practice questions, challenges and a large community of programmers
StackOverflow - Most Popular programming Q&A site on the web
Always follow good programming practice     
Good programming practice are the informal rules which can improve quality and decrease development time of the software.

Some of the programming practices mentioned here are valid in all programming languages whereas some are valid only for C programming. 

Be consistent with the formatting. 

The number of spaces you use in the program doesn’t matter in C. However, that doesn’t mean you should use different number of spaces at different places. Also, use proper indentation so that the code is easier to understand. 

Use one statement per line.

What’s wrong with the following code?

int count; float squareRoot = 10.0; printf(“Square root = %f”, squareRoot);
Actually, the code is perfectly valid. But, wouldn’t this be better:

int count;
float squareRoot = 10.0;
printf(“Square root = %f”, squareRoot);
The goal here is to write code that your fellow programmers can understand.

Naming convention and Consistency!

Give a proper name to variables and functions and be consistent with it. 

int a, b;
Here, a and b are two variables and I have no idea what they do. Instead you can choose name like:

int counter, power; 
Also, follow a convention while naming. For example:

int base_number, powerNumber;
Both conventions: using _ to separate words and using capital letter after first word is popular. However, don’t use both in one program; choose one and be consistent with it.
