  In queue and stack using linked list overflow condition arises if no memory is allocated by malloc function
  Graph can be empty but not tree
  A graph having no edges is called a Null Graph.It may have more than one vertices but no edge connecting any two of them.
  A graph with only one vertex is called a Trivial Graph. 
  A graph with no loops and no parallel/multiple edges is called a simple graph.
  The number of simple graphs possible with ‘n’ vertices = 2^nc2 = 2^(n(n-1)/2)
  A graph G is said to be connected if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.
  There should be at least one edge for every vertex in the graph. So that we can say that it is connected to some other vertex at the other side of the edge.
  A graph G is disconnected, if it does not contain at least two connected vertices.
  A graph G is said to be regular, if all its vertices have the same degree. 
  In a graph, if the degree of each vertex is ‘k’, then the graph is called a ‘k-regular graph’.

  An empty graph on n nodes consists of n isolated nodes with no edges. 
  Such graphs are sometimes also called edgeless graphs or null graphs (though the term "null graph" is also used to refer in particular to the empty graph on 0 nodes).
  The empty graph on 0 nodes is called the null graph, and the empty graph on 1 node is called the singleton graph.
  The empty graph on n vertices is the graph complement of the complete graph K_n, and is commonly denoted K^__n.
